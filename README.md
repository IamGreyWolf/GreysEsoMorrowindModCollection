# GreysEsoMods
A curated list of the ESO Mods I use.
This is a collection of Mods that help make the ESO experience more like the original Morrowind. Note that all of these go along with a series of settings for the game itself that makes the magic work.

## Goal
The goal of this collection of mods and settings is to help you make ESO feel more like the original TES3 Morrowind. 
By simplyfing UI, Visuals and removing unnecessary features, I was able to achieve a very good, classic & rpg feel for the game.

## Mod list
*NOTE: This is my personal collection of mods. If you feel like a mod does not belong here with this play style, remove it. Likewiese, if you feel like mods are missing for you to have more fun, please add your own.*
